The Nature of New York
<br><br>
It’s seven in the morning on a Monday and I wake up after going to bed at 2 the night
before. I’m getting ready for school, wishing I could lie back down on my bed for just another
fifteen minutes, feeling unmotivated and exhausted. Life seems dreary while I spread my peanut
butter on some toast and drink a cup of coffee that I know won’t make the feeling cease. Then I
remember the one thing I know will make my motivation and energy return: my morning bike to
school up the East River. Each morning I pass through the entrance of the fdr, it’s as if a weight
is lifted off my shoulder. Though I’m almost always in a hurry not to be late to school, I take the
time to appreciate the view as my music is playing. I notice the joggers, up early for their daily
exercise, and the people flooding off the ferry on their way to work. I pay close attention to the
details of the water and its background as if it's a painting, taking note of the sunlight reflecting
off the ripples, the speed of the river flowing, the huge wake of a tugboat pushing a barge, the
trains moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, while a mysterious morning mist floats above the
water.
<br><br>
    New York is a stressful place to live in, no matter who you are and how long you’ve lived
here. The crowded, tight streets filled with fast walking people trying to make it to their
destination embodies the tense energy of the city. Of all the ways to release this stress,
connecting with nature found around New York is one of the best. When viewing the city from a
place that captures its beauty, everything seems to slow down compared to the rest of NYC.
<br><br>
    Suddenly, your head is clear, and you can finally relax. Every New Yorker needs a place like this,
and for many, including myself, the East river is that place. The joggers I see in the morning, the
kids playing football and the old person sitting there alone are all experiencing the same effect as
I, even if they don’t realize it.
<br><br>
    Often I find myself by the river, not with any specific plan, but just sitting there
watching the intense pink sunset, pondering my future. New York is a vast and confusing place,
and the feeling of limitlessness can also cause people to feel lost on their path to success, but the
East river seems to shrink a large portion of it into one picture, making it easier to find a plan.
When people can see so much of the city in such a positive way, it can change their mindset from
being afraid of what it contains for them in the future to accepting it. I understand the feeling of
not knowing what the future holds, and in New York if you don’t set aside the time to
acknowledge it, it piles on stress.
<br><br>
    The East River, while just being a river, connected to a park with a little stone road to go
along, might not seem like much. But to me, like it is to many others, it is a special place. It’s the
place where I learned how to ride a bike, it’s the place where I have made many memories with
my family and with friends. Most importantly however, it’s a place that New Yorkers go where
they can slow down and appreciate the city instead of moving at the same pace as the rest of
New York. This doesn’t just apply to the East River, though. This same construct of meaning
could apply to any park, or really any place in New York. As long as you frequent the place, or
have gone often in the past, anywhere you go in NYC that allows you to see the city this way
holds a deeper meaning to yourself, and to your own definition of NYC. It could be something as
simple as a bench you like to relax on, a basketball court you used to play on every day after
school or work, it could really be anything. When you consider a place special, it’s not just
special for no reason; it's special because of the impact it had on your life. For me, this place is
the East River, but for anyone living in New York, any number of places could hold the same
meaning in their lives. That’s just how living in New York is.
<br><br>
    New York City is a place unlike any other, where you have an unlimited amount of
opportunity, not only career wise, but also opportunities to find yourself as a person, but if you
can’t find a limit for yourself, you can push too hard and lose focus on your goals. That's why
relaxation is an important part of the hectic lifestyle of New York City life. You can have a high
paying job, a great career path, maybe even already a great career, but if you don’t take the time
to give yourself leisure, and a little time to reflect on life and how you should live it, you won’t
feel fulfilled in life as a whole. The more time you spend thinking about your place, your role in
society, the more time you spend thinking about new things you want to try doing, new hobbies
you want to pick up, new ways to change your daily routine, the happier you will be in the City.
You have to stay true to your balance of working at your dreams, and working at bettering your
mental and physical state in order to live your best life in the city. New Yorkers that have times
of reflection will end up being more happy with themselves and their current situation, and will
continue to better themselves to make their future selves even better every day.
